Thank you Corrine! Could I please ask a few questions?

1. We need solder paste to be applied exactly where these files specify:

    - Top: MDCBoard.toppaste.ger
    - Bottom: MDCBoard.bottompaste.ger

    Some of the pads specified by those files won't have chips placed on them, but the pads still need solder. Can NextPCB handle that?

2. For parts that I'm supplying, do you accept cut-tape parts that aren't on a reel?

3. How do we make sure parts are oriented properly when placed on the board, especially diodes and LEDs?
    - Our board follows IPC-7351, is that enough?








- Are there any issues placing BGA parts?


- Need solderpaste everywhere specified by MDCBoard.toppaste.ger and MDCBoard.bottompaste.ger, not just for placed parts

- Don't want solderpaste in certain places, such as for large BGAs (image sensor, ICE40)
    - Is this possible with wave soldering? Are we using wave soldering?

- For parts that I'm supplying, do you accept cut-tape parts that aren't on a reel?

- How do we make sure parts are oriented properly when dispensed by the P&P machine and placed on the board?
    - Our board follows IPC-7351
    - https://www.eevblog.com/forum/eda/pcb-layout-guidelines/
        - "How does the PCB program know how the parts are oriented on the reels?"
    - The rotation in the MDCBoard.mnt / MDCBoard.mnb files is relative to how the parts are drawn in the library
