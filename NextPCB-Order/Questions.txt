- Are there any issues placing BGA parts?

- Need solderpaste everywhere specified by MDCBoard.toppaste.ger and MDCBoard.bottompaste.ger, not just for placed parts

- Don't want solderpaste in certain places, such as for large BGAs (image sensor, ICE40)
    - Is this possible with wave soldering? Are we using wave soldering?

- For parts that I'm supplying, do you accept cut-tape parts that aren't on a reel?

- How do we make sure parts are oriented properly when dispensed by the P&P machine and placed on the board?
    - Our board follows IPC-7351

        - "How does the PCB program know how the parts are oriented on the reels?"
    - The rotation in the MDCBoard.mnt / MDCBoard.mnb files is relative to how the parts are drawn in the library
