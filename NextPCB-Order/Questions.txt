- Are there any issues placing BGA parts?

- Need solderpaste everywhere specified by MDCBoard.toppaste.ger and MDCBoard.bottompaste.ger, not just for placed parts

- For parts that I'm supplying, do you accept cut-tape parts that aren't on a reel?

- How do we make sure parts are oriented properly when dispensed by the P&P machine and placed on the board?
    - The rotation in the MDCBoard.mnt / MDCBoard.mnb files is relative to how the parts are drawn in the library
